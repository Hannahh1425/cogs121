Our idea is similar to our proposal in milestone 1. Self-media is people who is 

Target user population: 1. Self-media who wants to know recent trend.
2. Self-media who wants to learn how to write articles that are attractive. 

None of our teammates fall in this user group because we are all not self-media, and we are not planning to learn about writing on social media.

Possible source is Medium's article dataset from Kaggle.
