Team Name: Little Yellow Duck


Team member: Ziwen Zeng, Yuhan Wang


We decided to implement a web app that gives self-media inspirations to 
write popular articles. Baiscally our web app will provide analysis of different
existing articles of different categories.


Target user population: 1. Self-media who wants to know recent trend.
2. Self-media who wants to learn how to read.

None of our teammates fall in this user group because we are all not self-media.


Possible source is Medium's article dataset from Kaggle.
