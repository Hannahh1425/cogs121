Our idea is similar to our proposal in milestone 1. We clarify our target user group as people who wants to write blogs to earn some extra money and people who is interested in writing blogs and want to learn more writing skills. In our web app, users can know current trends which is collected from "google-trends-api" and useful writing tips which is generated from exsiting good articles.

It is pretty similar to our prototype 2. 
  On the homepage, users can see today's trends. They can also see writing tips.
  After clicking in trends, they will see corresponding news to the trends. We think it will help them to gather more materials to write.
  When clicking in writing tips, users can see a list of suggested articles that are collected from other blogging websites. These articles usually have thousands of viewers.
  Users can click in each articles and see detailed analysis of these articles. 
  
We know that our current screenshot is too simple. However, we hope you can take into consideration that we only have 2 people in this team. We've really tried our best for this assignment. Thank you for understanding.
