Next step:
1. For our next step, we will not only display current day's trends, but also save the trends in the past three days and display them. In the bookmark page, we will split their bookmarks into 2 sections: trends and articles so that they can find what they want more easily.
2. We hope to change the UI layout and color scheme to be more consistent and pretty.
3. We may enable users to upload their articles into another section called "Training articles", and enable others to comment on it. But This step might need to use other cloud database, for example, firebase.

More ambitious data display or visualization ideas:
1. We need better datasets for our database. Now, our dataset comes from Kaggle open source which collects articles from Medium website. We hope we could also get datasets from more than five websites, for example, Quora, Reddit. By doing this, our database will be more inclusive
and representative.

2. We hope our dataset contains not only the columns we have now, but also have other columns like "article_category","article_trend","share_number","article_layout","title_structure". Then, we could make use those columns to get more statistics for "Daily hit" section, to make it more powerful and inclusive, and informative. And give user a better feeling of "catching up
with the latest information".
