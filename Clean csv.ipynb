/* File Header:

This file is a Python Juypter Notebook file that is used to clean the dataset downloaded from kaggle.
It cleans the missing, not available data, rename the columns, sort by popularity and create the
dataframe in the format we want, and finally output to a json file called new.json, which is used to
create sqlite database. */
