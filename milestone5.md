Storyboards: Our target uesr population is self media who just get started or already have some experience. For self media, attracting as many viewers as possible is one of an important standards for measuring their success. For a novice self media, they might not know how to write an article that attract people's attention, they can thus go to our "article" section to see those popular examples and learn from them. In addition, if it's difficult for them to capture hot topic and find good material to write about, they can go to our "trend" section to see current day's hot topic and read about relevant news. 

Improvement: 

Data visualization: We used Handlebars as our templating engine and Express as our backend. For the API we used, we call the API in backend and directly render template using res.render. For sqlite database, we call ajax call in the front-end and return generating HTML using string concat. when the ajax call completes successfully. 

Next step: For our next step, we will not only display current day's trends, but also save the trends in the past three days and display them. In the bookmark page, we will split their bookmarks into 2 sections: trends and articles so that they can find what they want more easily.	

User Action1: Bookmark article/news that you like; Delete bookmarked article.
User Action2: Sort articles on home page based on different criteria.
